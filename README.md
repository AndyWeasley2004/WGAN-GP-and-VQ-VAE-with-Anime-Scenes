# WGAN-GP-and-VQ-VAE-with-Anime-Scenes

Code for Cogs 185 Final Project, including a implementation of a Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty and VQ-VAE on a Japanese Anime Scene Dataset. And for anyone who is leanring GAN or VQ-VAE from scratch, you could read this repo as tutorial.

## Prerequisites
- Python and Pytorch
- A Nvidia GPU

## WGAN-GP
The notebook in this folder is the main training pipeline for WGAN. This GAN generate 128*128 images

## VQ-VAE
The notebook in this folder is the main training pileline for VA-VAE, and it can reconstruct the images into 256*256 resolution.
